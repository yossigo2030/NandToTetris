# NandToTetris
In this project I built a complete computer system.
In the first step I started from NAND and D-FLIP-FLOP gates and built from them simple but perfect computer.
The following parts appear on the computer:
1.Boolean Logic.
2.Boolean Arithmetic.
3.Sequential Logic.
4.Machine Language.
5.Computer Architecture.
6.Assembler.
7.Virtual Machine (Arithmetic).
8.Continue Virtual Machine (Control)
9.High Level Programming.
10.Compilation.
11.Continue Compilation (Code Generation)
12.Operating System.
good luck
